How do you take your caviar, sir ?  
  
No caviar for me, thanks.  
  
Never did like it much.  
  
And where exactly do you live, Mr.Dawson ?  
  
well, right now, my address is the RMS Titanic.  
  
After that, I'm God's good humor.  
  
And how is it you have means to travel ?  
  
I work my way from place to place.  
  
You know, tramp steamers and such.  
  
But I won my ticket on Tianic here at a lucky hand at poker.  
  
A very lucky hand.  
  
All life is game of luck.  
  
A real man makes his own luck, Archie.  
  
Right, Dawson ?  
  
And you find that sort of rootless existence appealing, do you ?  
  
Yes, ma'am, I do.  
  
I mean, I've got everything I need right here with me.  
  
I got air in my lungs and a few blank sheet of paper.  
  
I love waking  up in the morning not knowning what's gonna happen  
  
or who I'm gonna meet where I'm gonna wind up.  
  
Just the other night I was sleeping under a bridge, and now  
  
here I am on the grandest ship in the world having champagne with you fine people.  
  
I'll take some more of that.  
  
I figure life is a gift and I don't intend on wasting it.  
  
You never know what hand you're gonna get dealt next.  
  
You learn to take life as it comes at you.  
  
To make each day count.  
  
Well said, Jack.  
  
Hear, hear.  
  
To making it count
